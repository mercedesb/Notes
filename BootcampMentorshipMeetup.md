# Working Name: Developing Together 

## Elevator Pitch
Recently graduated from college or a coding bootcamp? Looking to land your first tech job? How do you continue to improve your technical skills after graduation? Web tutorials are a good first step for syntax but for higher level code design and architecture skills, coaching and mentorship is the best way to learn.

Technical and want to accelerate your promotion into management? Looking for low-commitment opportunities for guided mentorship practice? There are tons of new developers hungry for your perspective and feedback, come share your knowledge in a once monthly code review.

## Structure
- Once per month Meetup
- No standing commitment to be Mentor/Mentee, more ad hoc and based on RSVPs
- Mentors RSVP for slot (2 weeks before Meetup?)
  - Do we need to consider alternative sign up options to a Meetup RSVP?
- Open up 1 Mentee slot per RSVP-ed Mentor (1 week before Meetup?)
  - First come, first serve to start
  - If it's always the same people with a long waiting list, should we consider a rotating system?
  - PR for code review included with RSVP
    - Can Mentee submit repo to start?
    - If repo submitted, does the Mentor make a PR with comments?
- Upon RSVP, Mentors get a sheet with [resources for doing good code reviews](./CodeReviewResources.md)
  - links
  - what to look for
  - what feedback is good for people at the mentee's level, what feedback goes over their head and is too much
- Mentor has a week to review the Mentee's PR/repo and make comments
- 30 min training pre-Meetup for first time attendees
  - Mentors: how to code review, how to give feedback, how to pair
  - Mentees: how to PR, good commit structure, how to receive feedback, how to pair
- 1 hour for code review feedback, troubleshooting, pairing, etc
- During the 1 hour Meetup, Mentor should review all comments with Mentee
  - explain comments, teach concepts, etc
  - if time permits, pair with Mentee to implement some of the feedback

## Sponsorship
  - Contact info on Meetup page for sponsorship
  - Would prefer spaces with desks for pairing, pairing stations would be extra ideal
  - Minimum of 2 hours in the space required
  - Food/drink would be appreciated
  - Provide 10 minutes to talk about your company (if you want)
  - Partner with other Meetups? (don't want to step on their toes)
  
## Accountability
  - RSVP
  - If you are a Mentee and you skip the Meetup after RSVP-ing yes, you will not be allowed to sign up for a slot for 2 months
  - ~Refundable $5 fee?~ I don't like this idea, what accountability would make sense for Mentors?
    - if you show up, you get your money back
    - if you no-show, we donate your $5 to some tech related charity in the city (charity TBD)
    
## Outreach
  - For Mentees: reach out to bootcamps
    - Northwestern
    - Dev Bootcamp
    - Starter League
    - General Assembly
    - ...
  - For Mentors:
    - CTDI Slack
    - Chicago Tech Mentorship Slack
    - Share within my network
    - ... ideas?
    
## Other ideas
  - What to expect from your first job(s)
  - Small group reviews 
    - Volunteer some code to review as a small group (2-3 people)
    - Great for those who don't have enough code since the last session to PR but still want to learn what to look for 
    - Incorporate more Mentees if getting a balance is too challenging
  - Micro talks
    - 5 min
    - Have a list of ideas to start (library evaluation, short cool demo of something you made, I'm exploring this tech and what I've discovered so far, emacs/vim, etc)
    - Open to Mentors and Mentees alike
