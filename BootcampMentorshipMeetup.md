# Working Name: Developing Together 

## Elevator Pitch
TODO

## Structure
- Once per month meetup
- Mentors get a sheet with [resources for doing good code reviews](./CodeReviewResources.md)
  - links
  - what to look for
  - what feedback is good for people at the mentee's level, what feedback goes over their head and is too much
- 1 hour for code review feedback, troubleshooting, pairing, etc
- 30 min training pre-meetup for first time attendees
  - Mentors: how to code review, how to give feedback
  - Mentees: how to PR, good commit structure, how to receive feedback
- No standing commitment to be mentor/mentee, more ad hoc and based on RSVPs
- Mentors RSVP for slot (2 weeks before meetup?)
- Open up 1 mentee slot per RSVP-ed mentor (1 week before meetup?)
  - PR included with rsvp
  - Can mentee submit repo to start?
  - If repo submitted, does the mentor make a PR with comments?
- Mentor has a week to review and comment
- During the hour meetup, mentor should review all comments with mentee
  - explain comments, teach concepts, etc
  - if time permits, pair with mentee to implement some of the feedback
  
## Sponsorship
  - have contact info on Meetup page for sponsorship
  - would like 2 hours in the space
  - food/drink would be appreciated
  - 10 minutes to talk about your company (if you want)
  - partner with other meetups? (don't want to step on their toes)
  
## Accountability
  - RSVP
  - Refundable $5 fee?
    - if you show up, you get your money back
    - if you no-show, we donate your $5 to some tech related charity in the city (charity TBD)
    
## Outreach
  - reach out to bootcamps
    - Northwestern
    - Dev Bootcamp
    - Starter League
    - General Assembly
    - ...
    
## Other ideas
  - What to expect from your first job(s)
  - Small group reviews 
    - volunteer some code to review as a small group (2-3 people)
    - great for those who don't have enough code since the last session to PR but still want to learn what to look for 
  - Micro talks
    - 5 min
    - Have a list of ideas to start (library evaluation, short cool demo, I'm exploring this tech and what I've discovered so far, emacs/vim, etc)
    - open to mentors and mentees alike
